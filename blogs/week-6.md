# Sixth week

Previous week wasn't that interesting, because of it's simplicity. <br>
In ICT course we learned how to calculate the ip address, therefore nothing special.

<br>
However, this week is much more promising (especially the lab part).

So, for now (by now I mean monday) I've only got the fourth chapter to read and also lab 4.2.2.7. **Let's dive into it!**

## Fourth chapter
First, of all there are literally six sections to examine. Well, I have only one option....

<br>

From **introduction** part I got the point of this chapter, to show us the Physical and Data link layers working together forming Network Layer in the TCP/IP model.

<br>

**Physical layer** is responsible for transmitting via network media. There is a different types of media:
1. Coper cable - electrical pulses
1. Fiber-optic - patterns of light
1. Wireless - patterns of microwaves

Main functions of physical layer:
1. Use a physical components of network
1. Encoding the signal into the flow of bits
1. Signaling the data via a network media

Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data (in a given amount of time) which is using the b/s metric or bits per second.
<br>
Throughput is the measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time.

That's all the notes I have got about the physical layer.

There are a lot of different types of **network media** with their own properties.
For example:

1. Coper cables are limited to their distance. Signal could be interfered by EMI or RFI or Crosstalk. A few coper media types: UTP (Categories 3, 5 and 5e, 6), STP, Coaxial. Some UTP properties: Cancellation, Varying the number of twists per wire pair.
1. Fiber media types: single-mode, multi-mode.
1. Properties of wireless media: coverage area, interference, security, shared medium.

That's all notes I have got about the network media properties.

## Lab work
On lab we passed 4th task from previous lab. That was actually a challenge because of misunderstanding of some little beginning steps. However, I managed to pass. After such task we had a simple quiz for IP calculations. Overall, it was quite easy except for time limitations and my poor math calculation skills.

## Summary

This week wasn't that hard. All the problem is time this far. I need to finish my work to give more time to this course.
