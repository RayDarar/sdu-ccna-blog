# Eighth week

This week will be a conclusion of first term period. If I was trying to conclude, I would say that we actually passed pretty much for just 7 weeks, am I happy about it? Maybe not or maybe yes, it's actually depends on student's perspective.

So, overall I want to say first-term period was pretty much about the essentials of networking and actually gives to students information to change their point of view on how the Internet works. We were building local networks from scratch and having a different tasks to do either theoretical or with physical equipment. I was actually having fun playing kahoot and implementing different things.

For these period we have passed these topics:

- Application layer
- Transport layer
- Configuring Cisco OSI
- Network layer
- IP addressing
- Subnetting IP networks
- Different types of media
- Ethernet

At this week we had midterm, packet tracer project and a lot of online assignments on netacad.com.

## Application layer

We learned about different application layer's protocols like HTTP, DNS, DHCP, SMTP etc. We studied how really the Internet works in a nutshell.

## Transport layer

Next layer that we should know is a Transport layer that is dividing our data from application layer's protocols into segments and responsible for transporting these segments onto proper application on the correct port on remote network.

## Configuring Cisco OSI

SDU is collaborating with Cisco organization, so we are working with Cisco's network devices. This chapter showed us how to configure Switches and briefly got us into how they work.

## Network layer

After all previous abstractions we finally reached our first lower layer protocol. Network layer is responsible for passing segments within a network with minimum overhead. To do so, it's encapsulating transport layer's PDU into the packets.

## IP addressing

So we were about to study two different versions of Internet Protocol (IPv4, IPv6). We dived into subnet masks, binary operations and much more. Surprisingly IPv6 was not that weird after all, however hexadecimal values are hard to calculate and perceive at a first time.

## Subnetting IP networks

Next we learned how to subnet a network and got a bunch of theory about how we should design, configure-first and scale our networks. There were engineering questions that enabled us to think as a real network administrator. Subnetting is but not that hard process which is essential in the context of designing networks.

## Different types of media

Before this topic I used to have a different misconceptions about the cables, terms like Bandwidth or Throughput. Therefore, this one helped me the most in my study. Now I know a bunch of media types, where to use, why to use, advantages and disadvantages.

## Ethernet

This protocol was the most hard through all the chapters, because I haven't prepared pretty well. But found a way to understand! Packet Tracer's simulation mode that visualized to me the ARP process and hell yeah, I clearly understood how it works.

This was fun, but now I'm ready for the new material. Labs passed. Midterm was so easy, that I left the auditory after around 10 minutes. This first half of this course helped me so much. Thank you.
